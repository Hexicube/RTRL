RTRL - A game like a roguelike except it uses a tick system (real-time) and not a turn based one.

Concept:
  Tick based, allows more freedom with some effects like slowing as well as allowing a more logical food decay (7 minutes) instead of a step-based one.
  Wiring, so you can sabotage my traps if you have the tools without it seeming like some generic system for disarming.
  Being a douche, I will be taking all steps I can to make this as hard as I can without ruining it. You will starve to death, you can use fire potions on wooden doors (any door) or kick it down and mayeb get splinters which kill you.
  Slight realism, you can't stab a slime because it's gelatinous. You also can't burn skeletons because they're made of bones, but acid helps with them.

Controls:
  Arrow keys (may be changed to WASD): Movement
  E: Use tiles (open/close doors right now, will also have ability to use buttons/levers when I implement wiring)
  Q: Use current item (sword, potion, whatever) in the direction you're facing
  Z: Use current item on self if applicable (potions mainly, i.e. invisibility potion)

Enemies:
  Slime:
    Difficulty: Hard
    What this does: A slime will grab onto you and slowly start eating you. You will take acidic damage and, after long enough, suffocation damage.
    What can beat this: Anything that causes fire, slimes explode when lit.
  Skeleton:
    Difficulty: Easy
    What this does: Skeletons slowly follow you around and beat you to death. You will take blunt damage for each punch.
    What can beat this: Any kind of weapon, most potions (fire doesn't work).
  Will list more when ideas come through.
