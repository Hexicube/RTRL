#RTRL - A game like a roguelike except it uses a tick system (real-time) and not a turn based one.  
  
##Concept:  
* Tick based, allows more freedom with some effects like slowing as well as allowing a more logical food decay (7 minutes) instead of a step-based one.  
* Wiring, so you can sabotage my traps if you have the tools without it seeming like some generic system for disarming.  
* Being a douche, I will be taking all steps I can to make this as hard as I can without ruining it. You will starve to death, you can use fire potions on wooden doors (any door) or kick it down and maybe get splinters which kill you.  
* Slight realism, you can't stab a slime because it's gelatinous. You also can't burn skeletons because they're made of bones, but acid helps with them.  
  
##Controls (all numpad):  
* In-game:
    * 0: Open inventory  
    * 1: Use current item on self if applicable (potions mainly, i.e. invisibility potion)  
    * 2: Face a direction using movement keys  
    * 4/5/6/8: left/down/right/up (movement)  
    * 7: Use tiles (open/close doors, unlock doors, collect all items from chest)  
    * 9: Use current item (sword, potion, whatever) in the direction you're facing  
* Inventory:  
    * 0: Close inventory  
    * 1: Select item to move/Swap with selected item  
    * 2: Drop item on floor if space  
    * 3: Dispose of item  
    * 4/5/6/8: Navigate inventory  
    * 7: Use item on self (potions and stuff)  
  
##Enemies:
